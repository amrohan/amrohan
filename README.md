# Rohan Salunkhe — Full Stack Engineer

I'm a software engineer focused on building **scalable systems**, **modern web applications**, and **clean architecture**. My work spans from performant UIs to backend services that are resilient, testable, and production-ready.

With a deep interest in **software architecture**, **developer tooling**, and **cloud infrastructure**, I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, maintainable solutions.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- **Clarity over cleverness** – readable, maintainable code wins.
- **Own the stack** – from database schema to deployment.
- **Systems thinking** – understand the interactions, not just the parts.
- **Code for change** – software should evolve without friction.
- **Stay curious** – frameworks change, fundamentals last.
